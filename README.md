This github repository is for FIN535 final project, created by **Silvia(Xueli) DU** and **Xiani FAN**.



### Python Files:
- PathGen.py and McExperiments.py are the backbone, they are python code that have been imported in many other files to perform optimization, conduct simulations and compute important statistics of different portfolio allocation strategies.
- Main code that answers questions are stored in main.ipynb, Q1.ipynb, Q1 2.ipynb, QExten1.ipynb, Q_select_ptf.ipynb

### Figures and tables:
- For plots and tables generated, please refer to the Figures and storage cache folder. 

### EXCEL calculations:
- final sheet.xlsx are the EXCEL spreadsheets we employed to calculate some portfolio allocation strategies.

### Data:
- data.csv are the 20-year asset returns data our calculation and evaluation have been based on.
